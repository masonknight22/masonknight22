### Hi there :3
- 🦢 I am currently pursuing a Master of Science (M.S.I.E.) in Industrial Engineering at Purdue University, with a focus in Human Factors and Ergonomics. I am passionate about design, systems, and how our environment affects the human experience.
- 🦆 I also completed my undergraduate at Purdue University, holding a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Product Design, with minors in Psychological Science and Innovation & Transformational Change! I specialized in human-centered design and aesthetics.
- 👷‍♂️ I am currently a Mechanical Design Engineer at General Electric where I work with large-scale power and energy infrastructure, electromechanical components, and modeling the grid!
- 🛰️ I am a previous intern at Ball Aerospace, my work focused on knowledge and intelligence management for mission systems, including continuous improvement methods, model-based systems engineering, and user-interfaces!
- 🏗️ I am a previous structural engineering researcher at Bowen Laboratory, studying steel concrete composite structures under destructive blast conditions!
- 🏔 I have also previously done contract work or internships with AES Corporation, Northrop Grumman, PepsiCo, and Purdue Unviersity
- 🌱 I am interested in drawing, tennis, writing, hiking, and music!
